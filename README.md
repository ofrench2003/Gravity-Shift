# Gravity Shift

 Gravity Shift (name not final) is a 2D puzzle game where the user controls gravity instead of the player directly. The aim of the game is to get through the different levels and make it to the end of the game. the levels will get progressively harder as the user progresses and new mechanisms will be introduced to bring less repeatability to the game and allow the player to adapt their playstyle.
